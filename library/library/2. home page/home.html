    <h2>About:</h2>

    <p>Faculty of Technology is one of the newest faculties being adjoined to the prestigious University of Colombo.
        With the establishment of the faculty, the Technology Library was started as a branch library to the Main
        Library
        of the university. The library was temporarily functioning on the Main Library premises until the faculty built
        its own structure that was officially opened in 2020. The faculty library, at present, is located on the ground
        floor
        of the ICT Department (or D Block). The total collection of the faculty library is around 215 books, however, it
        has subscribed to 61 electronic books, too. Among many other Learning & Research Support Services (LRSS), the
        faculty library is committed to conduct information literacy series, orientation programs and to provide
        reference/referral services to students and staff. LRSS include training on Turnitin, Mendeley, Grammarly and
        various applications related to learning and research activities of the library users. Technology Library has
        consisted of an academic staff member and two non-academic staff members to serve the user community of the
        faculty
